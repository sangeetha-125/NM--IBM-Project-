📘 Single Phase Application

📝 Project Overview

The Single Phase Application is a system designed to monitor, control, and analyze single-phase electrical parameters. It helps users efficiently manage electrical loads, monitor voltage and current, and ensure the safe and optimal performance of single-phase circuits.

⚙️ Features

Real-time monitoring of voltage and current

Power consumption calculation

Overload and fault detection

Automatic switching control

Data logging and report generation

User-friendly interface


🧠 Objective

The main goal of this project is to design an application that ensures efficient use and protection of single-phase electrical systems while providing real-time data for analysis and maintenance.

🧰 Technologies Used

Hardware: Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino / PIC), Sensors (Current & Voltage)

Software: Embedded C / Python / JavaScript (depending on your implementation)

Tools: Proteus / Arduino IDE / Visual Studio Code


🔌 Working Principle

1. The system reads real-time voltage and current from sensors.


2. The microcontroller processes the readings.


3. Data is displayed on an interface (LCD, mobile app, or web dashboard).


4. The system can trigger alerts or control relays if abnormal conditions are detected.



📊 Applications

Home and industrial single-phase monitoring

Smart energy meters

Fault detection systems

Load management and automation


🚀 Future Enhancements

Add IoT-based remote monitoring

Integrate with cloud databases for data storage

Implement mobile app control

Introduce three-phase compatibility
